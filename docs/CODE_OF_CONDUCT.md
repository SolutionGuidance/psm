# Project Code of Conduct

This project is a community of professionals who work better when we
all treat each other with respect.  This document describes the
standards to which we aspire.

Participants in this project community are considerate of each other.
We are open to collaboration and receptive to constructive comment and
criticism.  We strive to welcome those who wish to contribute to our
efforts.

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers try to stay attentive in our
communications, and to be tactful and courteous when broaching
divergent or controversial views.

We require participants in our project and our community to maintain
high standards for rejecting harassment and discrimination,
particularly with regard to age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, employment,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive
environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Acting with empathy for other community members

Examples of behavior that harms our efforts to create a positive
environment include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassment, whether in public or in private
* Publishing others' private information, such as real name, or
  physical or electronic address, without permission
* Other behavior that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

We all share a responsibility to create an environment that encourages
behavior that meets these standards.  In addition, the
project maintainers (those who have direct push access to the repository)
are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to instances of unacceptable behavior.  Their own behavior
should be held to high standards.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to enforce this
Code of Conduct.  This might include removing, editing, or rejecting
contributions that do not meet standards.  It might also involve
suspending or banning participants who do not behave appropriately.

## Scope

We expect people to maintain these standards both within project
spaces and at events where they are representing the project or its
community. Examples of representing a project or community include
using an official project e-mail address, posting via project social
media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Meeting Our Responsibilities

Contributors are welcome and encouraged to resolve conflicts directly
with each other, when they feel comfortable doing so.

If issues can not be resolved directly among affected people, they should
report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior to the Code of Conduct team at
**`psm-coc{_AT_}solutionguidance.com`**. The current CoC team is:

* [Cecilia Donnelly](https://github.com/cecilia-donnelly)
* [Karl Fogel](https://github.com/kfogel)
* [Sumana Harihareswara](https://github.com/brainwane)
* [James Vasile](https://github.com/jvasile)

Contributors are also welcome and encouraged to contact the CoC team
to ask for advice on speaking with another contributor to resolve a
conflict directly.

The team will will review reports, make inquiries and respond as best
it can.  The individuals on the CoC team will maintain reasonable
confidentiality about confidential matters like the identity of
incident reporters, the reported participants in incidents, and the
details of reports.  At the same time, the team might discuss
publicly-known or non-confidential matters with the community,
especially when an incident affects a wider audience.
