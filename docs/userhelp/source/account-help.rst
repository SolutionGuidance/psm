Making and changing your account on this site
=============================================

How do I register for an account on this site?
----------------------------------------------

This depends on whether you are a healthcare provider or not.

If you're a healthcare provider:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the main page and click the "Register New Account" link.

A new account needs a username, first and last name, a user role, and an
email address. The site will create a random password and email it to
you, and will assume that the account is for a provider.

Your account can also have a middle name (this is optional).

This site does not enforce any limits on the number or type of
characters in the user's first name, last name, username or password.

You will need to have JavaScript turned on in your browser.

If you are not a healthcare provider:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You probably want to create an account to be a "service agent" (someone
who helps get providers enrolled) or a "service admin" (a state employee
who approves and rejects enrollments). Please speak with the state
Medicaid office for an account.

How do I log in?
----------------

Go to the main page of the website and enter your username and password,
and click the "Login" button.

I forgot my password. Can I retrieve or reset it?
-------------------------------------------------

On the main page, click the "Forgot Password?" link and enter your
username and email address. Click the "Reset Password" button. The
website will email you a new password to use to log in.

I registered using an old email address I don't have access to anymore, and I've forgotten my password. How can I log in?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to contact your state Medicaid office directly to get your
account information changed and to get a new password.

Someone stole my identity and created an account or took over my existing account. How do I get control of my account back?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get your account back after identity theft, you will need to contact
your state Medicaid office directly.

Can I change my username or password?
-------------------------------------

You can't change your username after you register it.

You can change your password using the Change Password page. Go to "My
Profile" and click the "Change Password" link.

Can I delete my account?
------------------------

No, you cannot. A future version of the PSM may let you do so.
