Provider help documentation
===========================

This is documentation for health care providers using the Provider
Screening Module.

Do I count as a provider?
-------------------------

Providers are people and organizations who render health care services,
group practices that furnish health care supplies to patients, and in
some cases, other people or organizations who are eligible to be
reimbursed through Medicaid for providing certain services.

Providers can be sole proprietorships or incorporated practices.

How do I change my name in this system? Can I update it in one place for all my enrollments?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an enrollment is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft enrollment and edit your name. If you have
already submitted the enrollment, then it is not possible to edit your
name as associated with that enrollment; you'll need to contact the
state Medicaid office directly.

Currently it is not possible for you to change your name for your
account; you will need to contact a system administrator at your state
Medicaid office to do this.

How do I update my contact information for an approved enrollment? Can I update it in one place for all my enrollments?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once an enrollment has been approved, you cannot change the contact
information in it via this system (although a future version of the PSM
will allow you to do this); please contact the state Medicaid office
directly.

How do I update my license/certification information for an approved enrollment (e.g., if I have renewed my license)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once an enrollment has been approved, you cannot change the license and
certification information in it via this system (although a future
version of the PSM will allow you to do this); please contact the state
Medicaid office directly.
