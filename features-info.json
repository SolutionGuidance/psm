We do not expose PostgreSQL on the testing server to the internet, only to localhost. We use the Liquibase gradle plugin to execute migrations, so the migrations need to be run from a checkout of the repo.\r\n\r\nThe testing server is currently up-to-date on migrations, but of course will not remain so; that means we do not have to worry about any duplicate table definitions from a previously-run `seed.sql` script.\r\n\r\nI see a few options:\r\n\r\n- open an SSH tunnel from Jenkins to the testing server that connects PostgreSQL, and run the migrations from Jenkins\r\n- somehow update a checkout on the testing server (push/pull), and run the migrations from there\r\n\r\nFollow-up from #254 Allow database schema changes without losing data",

            "title": "Remove jBPM",
            "description": "We are using [jBPM](https://www.jbpm.org/), the Java Business Process Model, in the PSM. We should remove it and replace it with something simpler. (We should continue to use our rules engine, Drools.)\r\n\r\njBPM is a large, powerful, and flexible framework. It offers the ability to have many workflows, called business processes, which it manages on behalf of the application. These workflows are supposed to be easy to modify or replace, so as to custom-fit a particular deployment of the client application without a lot of custom code. jBPM also offers the capability of providing a user interface to handle steps in the business process that require user interaction.\r\n\r\nThe way the PSM uses jBPM makes it difficult for us to benefit from the features and benefits of jBPM, while still imposing the overhead and complexity of a heavyweight framework. The PSM has a single business process, and the jump between native Java code and the jBPM-specific code makes it more difficult for developers to understand how the application works. Our experience of attempting to modify that single business process has been time-consuming and required both a higher level of expertise and more custom Java code than we\u2019d hoped. The UI that jBPM offers does not look like the rest of the PSM, and so instead we have our own custom UI, written in Java and JSPs like the rest of the application. Finally, the way that the PSM integrates with jBPM makes it nearly impossible to upgrade jBPM to a more modern, supported version.\r\n\r\nThese problems have already had negative consequences in our development, in the form of seemingly simple changes requiring extensive work. We've tried three times to upgrade the version of jBPM we're using, and each time been unable to do so in the time we were willing to spend on it. Even small changes, like switching an input field from \"EFT Vendor Number\" to \"Do you accept EFT? [ ] Yes [ ] No\" radio buttons (#531), ended up taking longer and being more difficult than it sounds like it should be, due largely to the design decisions imposed upon the project by the integration with jBPM. Most notably, upgrading our external rules server (#385) is blocked until we remove jBPM.\r\n\r\nOur single business process is pretty straightforward. There are essentially two parts: 1. new enrollment application submitted -> run automatic screenings -> run screening Drools rules, and 2. enrollment application approved -> make sure screening Drools rules pass -> do approval post-processing. Each of these can be done with plain Java code.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we work backwards from the terminal nodes of the workflow, and switch those jBPM work item handlers into plain Java code, one-by-one. After switching all the work item handlers over, we can remove jBPM.\r\n\r\nAn important aspect of this plan is that the PSM remains in a working state throughout the development process. If our priorities shift, we will be able to pause development on removing jBPM, with only the cost of context-switching. Our work can be merged as we go, using our usual review process, rather than having a giant, potentially problematic switchover all at once.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*This was [originally proposed](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/psm-dev/QE56HlIeWiI/rJwn05BeAgAJ) on the [psm-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psm-dev). Since then, we have learned that jBPM does not background its work (one of the few benefits we thought we were getting from it), tried a third time to upgrade Drools and jBPM, removed the unused and unimplemented steps of the business process, and learned enough about the remaining steps to believe they should be plain Java code instead of message-driven event handlers. This issue reflects those changes.*",

For revalidation they need to resubmit periodically, and also if something changes that requires an update and re-screen.)\r\n\r\nAn option:  If an application was 'approved' we could keep it as 'approved' and open a new copy as 'draft'. That would avoid the situation of a provider being approved but their application not appearing as approved, but as draft.  On the other hand it is more consistent to have it work the same as with the other statuses.\r\n\r\nWe considered having an 'in review' status and/or a way to lock and prevent an application from being \"edit and resubmit\"-ted while it was under manual review.

            "description": "Under the initial implementation (#910) of the monthly re-screening feature (#740), we assume that the only errors that escape from the external screening class are fatal, unrecoverable errors. @frankduncan [points out](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/pull/910#discussion_r199346892) that it's useful to try to re-screen the remaining re-screen-able enrollments rather than abort on the first such error:\r\n\r\n> In production, automatic screenings are running against all approved enrollments for all time. Two years down the road, we add a new automatic screening that works for all new enrollments because data is enforced as being added (a change introduced by this new screening project in the website workflow), so the new enrollments don't lead to a 500 error during submission. However, when pushed to production, the new screening runs on all old enrollments that were screened successfully years ago, that don't have that necessary data. What do we want to have happen? Personally I think it's useful to have the process continue and finish on all the enrollments it can, just so work can continue on those enrollments while operations people look into the issue for the specific enrollments that have problems.\r\n\r\nMake sure that each re-screening-eligible enrollment is re-screened against each external data source (LEIE, DMF, ...), regardless of errors.\r\n\r\nAs part of this, we need to investigate and think about transactionality; it's no use to handle errors but then throw away all the results because the transaction manager decided that one of those errors means it needs to roll back the transaction.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n- Issue #740 Re-screen approved providers monthly\r\n- PR #910 Re-screen approved enrollments monthly",

            "title": "Suggestion about using jCasbin in the AuthZ interceptor",
            "description": "Hi. I found we are adding authorization security to the RESTful API (https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/847) and there's also some related commit here: https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/commit/aa1c15ec87595939469563592f781ea83b94d70c.\r\n\r\nIt seems that we are looking for a light-weight authorization library. Spring security is too heavy for this scenario.  To avoid re-inventing the wheel, I'd like to recommend: [jCasbin](https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin), which is an authorization library that supports models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC.\r\n\r\nRelated to RBAC, casbin has several advantages:\r\n1. roles can be cascaded, aka roles can have roles.\r\n2. support resource roles, so users have their roles and resource have their roles too. role = group here.\r\n3. the permission assignments (or policy in casbin's language) can be persisted in files or database.\r\n4. multiple models like ACL, BLP, RBAC, ABAC, RESTful are supported. For RESTful, you can use the built-in ``keyMatch`` function to match a RESTful path to a pattern like ``/books/*``, or use regex directly.\r\n\r\nAnd you can even customize your own access control model, for example, mix RBAC and ABAC together by using roles and attributes at the same time. It's very flexible.\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at your code, I think jCasbin just provides all you need to implement a RESTful interceptor and nothing else is involved. You can see our interceptor examples here: https://github.com/casbin/jcasbin#web-frameworks. In all examples, HTTP basic authentication is used as the authN way, but you can switch to any authentication as you like.\r\n\r\nI think jCasbin can be a choice. What do you think? Thanks.",

Wouldn't this just be a property of the username?  IOW, if you just create a new account via the \"Register New Account\" link, then by default that is a provider account.  When a new state-side admin account is created, it will be created by an existing state-side admin who has the appropriate superpowers to create such accounts.

            "title": "Change Practitioner and Organization from Contained Resources to References in FHIR endpoint",
            "description": "Currently, the FHIR API endpoint returns a list of `Task` resources with either a `Practitioner` or `Organization` resource contained within them, depending on the type of Provider Screening Application.  This effectively allows implementers to see all the information, but it may not be the best way to model the data, for two reasons:\r\n1. None of the existing FHIR profiling tools ([Forge](https://fire.ly/forge/), [Trifolia](https://trifolia.lantanagroup.com/), [shr-cli](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr-cli/wiki/CIMPL-Documentation)) support constraints on contained resources.\r\n2. Semantically, it makes sense to use `contained` when the contained resource [does not have a unique identifier in the source system](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html#contained).  I could be wrong, but I think that Practitioners and Organizations have unique IDs in the PSM database.\r\n\r\nI propose that the ID for each `Practitioner` and `Organization` resource be returned instead as the [`focus`](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/task-definitions.html#Task.focus) of each `Task`.  The HAPI-FHIR documentation has information about how to [return these resources as references](http://hapifhir.io/doc_resource_references.html#References_in_Server_Code) and the FHIR search documentation has information about how to [query for Task resources in a way that returns the `Practitioner` and `Organization` resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#revinclude) within the bundle.",

            "description": "This came up in a recent conversation regarding external sources.  There may be regressions for enrollments that depend on the LEIE or DMF.  Because we may not boot these up when doing integration testing (on CI, for instance), and the overhead of adding test versions of these services may not be worth the cost, we still need a way to ensure that the application is regression proof on some of the pages depending on information that these services return.  A quick way to ensure this happens is to put the database into a state with seed data equivalent to the different response types these external services may return.\r\n\r\nHowever, as we build out test database data, it continues to pollute development databases, and may run into errors from other, older development data (and in the future, from database population from production needed to debug errors).  A solution would be to load up a secondary test database when running integration tests that can be torn down after.\r\n\r\nMost likely there is no need to have a setup/teardown mid integration tests.",

It looks to me like @frankduncan's changes in response to my request in #815 mean that the enrollment is now (properly!) linked to a user, not just the user_id string.

For individual enrollment applications, the contact email is sometimes autofilled from the \"Email Address\" input by using the \"Same as Above\" checkbox.  That \"Email Address\" field is *not* required in and of itself.\r\n\r\n@frankduncan noticed that if a user fills in information, leaving the Email Address input empty (allowed) and checking the \"Same as Above\" checkbox, the ensuing error is unclear.  The \"Same as Above\" checkbox means that the Email Address is suddenly required, because it fills the Contact Email field, which is required.  I hope this is comprehensible.\r\n\r\nI thought that the thing to do was to add an error to the new Contact Email rule which would change the error text if the \"Same as Above\" checkbox was checked, so that the red highlighting would appear around the \"Email Address\" field and the error text would read \"Email Address is required when Same as Above is checked.\"  While doing that, I found that the rules currently don't appear to have any concept of the Email Address field at all, meaning that adding an error reporter on that field has no effect.\r\n\r\nI believe that the way to add this element to the rules is by adding it to the \"PersonalInformation\" fieldset, which appears to be generated from the JAXB \"PersonType\".

This might be for one of several reasons:\r\n\r\n1) The requirement was already handled in the original TopCoder work of 2013 and before.\r\n2) The requirement is one of those things that just naturally gets taken care of in the course of building a provider screening module (e.g., if the requirement is that \"The PSM shall screen providers\", that's something we might never have an actual ticket filed for).\r\n3) We haven't yet started work on the requirement as of early March 2018, when the first big RTM<->issues mapping sweep was done.  For those requirements, we expect them to have issues (other than this one) eventually, but those issues just haven't been filed yet because we haven't gotten to that part of the roadmap yet.  In theory, we could file issues for those features way in advance, but we're not currently doing a \"one master ticket per requirement\" thing, so filing in advance would be premature as we'd be unable to be technically specific.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a given requirement currently points to this issue doesn't tell you whether it's because of (1), (2), or (3).  However, it does tell you that someone has already gone through the effort of trying to find issues that correspond to that requirement, and, assuming no other issues are labeled with that requirement, that no match has been found yet.\r\n\r\nThere's no need to remove a requirement label from this issue once that requirement has other issues associated with it.  This issue will be closed as soon as it is opened, so it won't block the completion of any requirement.",

We prefer not to depend on proprietary services.\r\n2. Jenkins allows us to set up scripts and infra about our CI outside of this repository.  One specific CI setup will not be applicable to other groups who want to use this repository, so it's better to separate it from the application code itself.\r\n3. Fix our unreliable Wildfly deployment on Travis (see #304).  (This has been resolved, but could come up again.)\r\n4. Fix our unreliable connection to Sauce Labs on Travis (see #533), by running the integration tests on the Jenkins server.  This also removes another dependency on a proprietary service, since we wouldn't need to use Sauce Labs anymore.\r\n5. Ability to split our CI checks into separate streams, e.g., as @jasonaowen put it \"separate, parallel CI checks - splitting linting, and unit tests, and integration tests, and building, and whatever else into separate jobs that each run on a new PR.\"  This would be easier with Jenkins, and would allow us to more easily see the difference between \"this PR breaks a feature\" and \"this PR has style problems.\"\r\n6. Run some updates on a regular, but not every PR, cycle.  Most immediately, this refers to things like updating the GitHub Pages site, as in PR #445.  We don't need a new copy of the generated files for every PR, but the site needs to be kept up-to-date.  Doing this weekly or similar would be easier with Jenkins.\r\n7.

They're harder to understand, and they often duplicate other, traditional Java classes that we also use, which necessitates meaningless type name distinguishment.

The names don't give any clues, but it turns out the first is used with Hibernate and the second is a JAXB-generated class.\r\n- What is the difference between [`LicenseType`](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/blob/6cbecea2b58b51b46fde3f1b76447098e5287eec/psm-app/services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/entities/LicenseType.java) and [`LicenseType`](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/blob/6cbecea2b58b51b46fde3f1b76447098e5287eec/psm-app/cms-business-model/src/main/resources/Entities.xsd#L525-L540)?

Both are traditional Java classes, used with Hibernate - and while the second could probably use a better name, I include it here to point out that you can't always tell the JAXB classes because they have `Type` appended to the end of the name.\r\n\r\nAs a simpler example, and an easier set of classes to remove, some of the parameter and return types are specified in [`EnrollmentServiceAPI.xsd`](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/blob/b9cd35ef961aca36c0d61c61948b0aae24bf5bd3/psm-app/cms-business-model/src/main/resources/EnrollmentServiceAPI.xsd), such as for the method [`getTicketDetails`](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/blob/bcab22c4ec8ccc5f7b2c7b2a9519a5c1b09d032f/psm-app/cms-business-process/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/services/impl/EnrollmentWebServiceBean.java#L196-L209). There is only one caller, the return type has only a single member variable, and the parameter type has four simple data types in it. It makes the method harder to understand, and it makes [the single(!) call site](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/blob/be7d145fb55acc98dcf9eb0b0a554c0b3b04f1db/psm-app/cms-web/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/controllers/EnrollmentPageFlowController.java#L889-L895) harder to understand and harder to modify.\r\n\r\nRemove these complicating classes as and when we can.",

These rules are run during the enrollment review process, and mostly relate to things like [\"the reviewer must validate the NPI\"](https://github.com/solutionguidance/psm/blob/3ac7ba0b5b130b45bb5f30be14bb88cda414e551/psm-app/cms-business-process/src/main/resources/cms.screening.drl#L482-L501).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also screening rules about the content of the enrollment, and those rules should be moved out of the screening rules and into the validation rules, so that the provider can find out about such errors before submitting the enrollment application. (As a side benefit, it is surprising to a reviewer to click \"approve\" and then not have the enrollment status be set to approved because it failed some rule - reducing the opportunities for that to happen is valuable.)\r\n\r\nSee also #571 Remove MN-specific rules, one of which raised this problem by being a screening rule rather than a validation rule.\r\n\r\n[1] From [RTM.xslx](https://github.com/solutionguidance/psm/blob/7accb4c29d75c6a6b495d41daca24f6fb079f655/requirements/RTM.xlsx), functional reqs, line 90: psm-FR-7.11",

            "title": "Potential misuse of the PSM by an agent",
            "description": "We've been discussing the agent/provider permissions divide in #10, and someone brought up a possible problem with allowing an agent unlimited access to a provider's account:\r\n\r\n>Administrative person (an agent) in a clinic in one state (State 1) has access to her physician supervisor\u2019s information including NPI. She moves to another state (State 2) and starts working in a low-risk provider type practice (no site visit required), also as an agent. She applies to enroll her old boss through the provider screening module, without his knowledge and lists his bank information as hers. Because she works for a clinic in State 2, she knows some Medicaid beneficiaries and the information needed to submit claims for them. After getting her old boss from another state enrolled in State 2's MMIS, she starts filing fraudulent claims with payments going to her.\r\n\r\nWe're not handling bank information in the PSM, but this points to one reason why we should be making it easier for states to share information about their providers.  If an NPI is already registered in one state, we might want to add extra scrutiny to that NPI being registered in another state.  There might be valid reasons for it (a provider lives on the border and performs services in both states), but I can see an argument for it indicating higher risk.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think we can present a purely technical solution to the broader problem of agents misusing their access to provider accounts.  There will always be providers that give their agents access to their accounts, no matter what technical obstacles we put in the way.  \r\n\r\nSince this example involves another state, we could also make sure that the address given by the provider matches the one associated with their license in the state's file.  Presumably, in the example above, the provider wouldn't be licensed in State 2, and so would be rejected by the PSM.  We'll have to talk to states about how much friction that's likely to cause for legitimate providers: how often do they update their license files?  How often do providers move?",

To update this term everywhere would mean a big code change which we aren't in a position to make right now (I don't think).

Update the existing Makefile to also produce a (professional-looking, logo-featuring) PDF, which we can `make` and distribute by hand to begin with.\r\n2. Include the `make` of the userdocs in our CI, as you did with the API docs, and link to them from https://opentechstrategies.github.io/psm/.  \r\n3. Add the `make` of the new PDF to the CI too, and make it downloadable from the docs site.\r\n\r\nI don't *think* this is a duplicate of #395.  To me, this is a clarification of one part of #395, which we're going to complete first.  Happy to move this over there, though, if others think that makes more sense.",

On the \"Practice Info\" screen, the user should say \"Yes\" to the question \"Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group practice?\" and enter the organization's information.\r\n\r\nKarl says:\r\n\r\n> This sounds a little weird, in terms of the eventual results it would produce in the PSM's data. In the first scenario, it sounds like a given provider just gets another member (but there's still only one provider). In the second case, it sounds like a new provider would be created? That's an odd thing to have be dependent on the mere timing of when a doctor joined a hospital or whatever.

The *admin* account, however, was able to submit the enrollments after logging in.\r\n\r\nThis was on my local setup, which was idiosyncratic in that I had manually reset the status of the enrollments in question to \"draft\" (in a `psql` shell, by running something like `update \"enrollments\" set \"enrollment_status\" = '01';`).  I don't remember if they had already been reviewed when I reset them.  If so, that might have been the source of the problem.  I'd manually reset statuses before without this problem, but perhaps those enrollments were only \"pending.\"  I'll investigate.",

            "description": "Per @jasonaowen in https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/195#issuecomment-314795045 , we need to decide whether to repair and use, or delete, the help topics system.\r\n\r\n> I reviewed the help system in more depth today. We already knew it was incomplete; users cannot see help items admins create. Finishing that implementation is possible, but may not be the most effective use of our time.\r\n\r\n> The help system stores its help items (as it calls them) in the database. This allows for admins to create, edit, and delete topics at runtime. This may be useful for state-specific topics, but topics that all states need would have to be included in the seed data.\r\n\r\n> Seeding help items is fine, but such seeded help topics are not great for contextual help: we should be careful about providing a help link next to, say, a disclosure question that goes to a dynamic help page - admins could accidentally delete it, thinking it unnecessary in their environment, and be unable to restore it; there are few things more frustrating than clicking on a help link and receiving a 404 error. If we're seeding the data, and hardcoding links, it would be simpler to just write contextual help directly instead of building and using our own custom CMS.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, maybe it really is useful to allow each state to customize its help documentation, and it is worth hardening pre-seeded help items against deletion. If we're providing separate docs for providers and admins, we would also want to build access controls around help topics. This is doable; we have examples of similar pages and patterns in the application.",

For example, if a match was found in the LEIE, does the admin need to manually verify the provider's SSN using the official LEIE site?

            "description": "# Problem\r\nAs part of PR #279 we need to be able to run the full suite of Serenity tests against a freshly deployed\r\napplication, running in the travis container. I've been working on this off and on for several weeks and\r\nthe best I can come up with is unreliably unreliable (it works just often enough to make us feel that it should work).\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\nIn the `204_selenium_tests` branch the travis.yml file has entries to call a script called `start-wildfly-deploy-application.sh' which:\r\n\r\n- Creates the PSM database and user on the travis-provided Postgres server\r\n- Loads the seed data into the database\r\n- Downloads the Postgres jdbc driver\r\n- Starts up wildfly in standalone mode\r\n- Deploy's Postgres driver and creates data sources\r\n- Configures wildlfly to talk to the travis-provided SMTP server\r\n- Finally deploys the freshly build EAR file to the server\r\n\r\nThe travis.yml file has some additions to it:\r\n\r\n- Tells travis to launch a Postgres 9.6 service in the container\r\n- Install Firefox version 46.0.1 (the latest version of Firefox compatible with our selenium drivers)\r\n- Sets environment variables to help selenium find the Firefox binary and X-windows virtual display\r\n- Start the Xwindows virtual display service so we can run Firefox headlessly\r\n- Build the EAR file\r\n- Deploy the EAR file\r\n- Finally run tests against the running application\r\n\r\n# Current Situation\r\nThere are two common failure modes:\r\n\r\n1. When starting wildfly you get an exception that it can't start JMS due to a missing dependency: \r\n```\r\n19:55:23,058 INFO  [org.jboss.ws.common.management] (MSC service thread 1-6) JBWS022052: Starting JBossWS 5.1.5.Final (Apache CXF 3.1.6)\r\n\r\n19:55:23,107 ERROR [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 64) AMQ224000: Failure in initialisation: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot initialize queue:Resource temporarily unavailable\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. After wildfly is reloaded to accept the data sources we deploy the app and we get a different error (which I can't find in my history, but it is similar)\r\n\r\nI thought the second failure mode was caused by attempting to deploy in the middle of the restart and tried adding a second call to `wait_for_wildfly` but that introduced a race condition since the restart can happen quickly and that script misses the line in the log file that it is supposed to wait on.\r\n\r\nLately I've seen that I can get past the first failure mode by clearing out the travis cache, build. It fails, try again and it succeeds, try again and it fails thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",

We start out in a clone of our repo already, which Travis checks out on our behalf. I believe the variable [`$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables) contains the location of that checkout, or you can just `cd ..` to get out of the `psm-app` subdirectory.\r\n\r\n> 2. The API docs are generated in a build directory, which is ignored by `.gitignore`. The `gh-pages` branch does not have a `psm-app` directory, so switching branches leaves those built files behind.\r\n\r\n> 3. `git push` [allows pushing to a URL](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#git-push-ltrepositorygt)\r\n\r\n> Given all that, I think all we need do is switch branches, move the docs from `psm-app/build/reports/api-docs`, add them as usual, commit, and push to the URL above.

From a security perspective, it would be ideal to build all the deps from source; failing that, we might want to at least record expected hashes and check that they match what is actually fetched (maybe Maven does this for us?

Are there \"cross-platform templating solutions\"?  i.e., can we use a template that can be generated by Java and Python code?  For example, if we ever want to put a web interface on the [ETL process](https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/tree/master/etl), which is being done with Python, it should use the same templates that we use for the main app, even though that's written in Java.\r\n",

For a CI process we need to be able to deploy the generated application to a sandbox instance.\r\n\r\nThe best solution would be to update the Dockerfile to include the EAR file in the docker image. The database docker container would have a startup step that builds the database from `seed.sql` and `legacy_seed.sql` so that the end result is a complete installation of the application, ready for testing.\r\n\r\nAnother issue would be how to deploy the docker compose environment upon build.

Lazily-loaded relations, like `ProviderType#agreementDocuments`, are not initialized by default, since the query to look them up can be very expensive. The partially-initialized object throws an exception when you try to access any of its uninitialized fields. The code that wants the `ProviderType` instance doesn't need the `agreementDocuments`, but the logging framework is trying to serialize the instance to JSON, and warning when it fails to do so.\r\n\r\nMake these warnings go away. Ideally we could figure out how to serialize only as much of the object as is initialized; less ideal would be to only serialize the non-optional parts, regardless of whether they're loaded; alternatively, we could decide that this kind of performance logging is better done by another method (a library? something built into the application server? a service like new relic?), and replace the logging framework entirely.",

This means that the same information - \"acupuncturists require an acupuncture license\" - lives in two places (at least in the simple case - there may be more complicated rules).\r\n\r\nThis duplication makes changing the system more difficult: adding a new provider type means creating a new `ProviderType` (see also #41), creating a new `LicenseType`, linking the two in the database, and creating validation rules in drools (which requires a code change).\r\n\r\nWe should look more closely at the validation rules and see if we can move them to the database.",

I believe all states also consult [PECOS](https://pecos.cms.hhs.gov/pecos/login.do#headingLv1), but see [this GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-402) on the wide variety of databases that states and managed care plans consult when screening providers.\r\n\r\n__2. How crucial is it to the function of the PSM?__\r\n\r\nEPLS and PECOS both show up in many places in the codebase (245 instances of EPLS and 199 instances of PECOS), while NPPES and LEIE only appear in the documentation.  So, likely EPLS and PECOS would be preferred for this one.\r\n\r\n__3. What steps do we need to take to use data from it?  Does it have an API or standard ETL process?__\r\n\r\nEPLS data is available in a public extract [here](https://www.sam.gov/portal/SAM/?navigationalstate=JBPNS_rO0ABXdcACJqYXZheC5mYWNlcy5wb3J0bGV0YnJpZGdlLlNUQVRFX0lEAAAAAQApdmlldzpiOWYzY2M4Yi1hZWZmLTRkMmQtOWU0MC01YzkxZTg0MjAyNTYAB19fRU9GX18*&portal:componentId=24f38525-a064-4a77-b09f-3fa5986c2b48&interactionstate=JBPNS_rO0ABXc0ABBfanNmQnJpZGdlVmlld0lkAAAAAQATL2pzZi9uYXZpZ2F0aW9uLmpzcAAHX19FT0ZfXw**&portal:type=action##11), but there are restrictions on access: \r\n\r\n>Systematic access (electronic harvesting) or extraction of content from the website, including the use of \"bots\" or \"spiders\", is prohibited.\r\n\r\nPECOS doesn't have an API yet, and at least some states still do manual lookups.

It depends on libraries provided by the application server - this is potentially something to change later - and my WIP branch pulls those libraries in. \r\n\r\nRather than depending on Wildfly to provide libraries, manage dependencies via a few different `build.xml`s or use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).  For example:\r\n\r\n- `wildfly-config/build.xml` points at Wildfly libraries\r\n- `websphere-config/build.xml` downloads stuff from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)\r\n\r\nThe exact approach will be fleshed out as we go.

The method checks the value and throws an exception.\r\n\r\n>2) In other beans, for instance the HealthCareCommonDAO, the same check is done inline.  This means both the check logic and the exception itself are handled separately each time.\r\n\r\n>Examples of inline checks:\r\n\r\n> - PodiatricMedicineLicenseDAOBean.java (line 98)\r\n\r\n> -  SocialWorkLicenseDAOBean.java (line 109)\r\n\r\n> - PhysicalTherapyLicenseDAOBean.java (line 112) <-- notice here the code doesn't use the ErrorCode object (as in the other files) but instead has a hand coded string.\r\n\r\n>The main reason this is a concern is not so much the check itself, but the result of the check -- the exception being thrown is not necessarily going to be consistent over time and, in fact, isn't even\r\nconsistent now.  This would not be the case if DRY hadn't been violated.\r\n\r\nNote also that this doesn't even touch on the fact that (on master) we have both `pesp-jboss/cms-external-sources/services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/screening/dao/impl/PodiatricMedicineLicenseDAOBean.java` and \r\n`pesp-was8.5-ext-srcs/services/src/main/java/gov/medicaid/screening/dao/impl/PodiatricMedicineLicenseDAOBean.java`, which are the exact same file.\r\n\r\n",
