        <strong>Agent</strong> means any person who has been delegated the authority to obligate or act on behalf of the provider.

    <div class="section">
        <strong>Managing</strong> employee means a person who exercises operational or managerial control over, or who directly or

            indirectly conducts or manages the day-to-day operations of an institution, organization, agency or school, such as a

            general manager, business manager, administrator, director.
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <strong>Ownership or control interest</strong> means any person, business or organization to which any one or more of the

            following apply:
        <ul>
            <li>Direct ownership of 5% or more in the disclosing entity</li>
            <li>
                Indirect ownership interest equal to 5% or more in a disclosing entity (meaning ownership in another entity that has an ownership interest in the disclosing entity)

                Determine the amount of indirect ownership interest by multiplying the percentages of ownership in each entity.

                For example, if A owns 10% of the stock in a corporation which owns 80% of the stock of the disclosing entity,

                A's interest equals an 8% indirect ownership interest in the disclosing entity and must be reported. Conversely, if

                B owns 80% of the stock of a corporation which owns 5% of the stock of the disclosing entity, B's interest equals

                a 4% indirect ownership interest in the disclosing entity and need not be reported

            </li>
            <li>A combination of direct and indirect ownership interest equal to 5% or more in the disclosing entity</li>
            <li>
                Owns an interest of 5% or more in any mortgage, deed of trust, note or other obligation secured by the

                disclosing entity if that interest equals at least 5% of the value of the property or assets of the disclosing entity

                Determine the percentage of ownership, mortgage, deed of trust, note, or other obligation by multiplying the

                percentage of interest owned in the obligation by the percentage of the disclosing entity's assets used to secure

                the obligation. For example: If A owns 10% of a note secured by 60% of the provider's assets, A's interest in the

                provider's assets equals 6% and must be reported. If B owns 40% of a note secured by 10% of the provider's

                assets, B's interest in the provider's assets equals 4% and need not be reported

            </li>
            <li>Is an officer or director of a disclosing entity that is organized as a corporation (for profit or non-profit)</li>
            <li>Is a partner in a disclosing entity that is organized as a partnership.</li>
