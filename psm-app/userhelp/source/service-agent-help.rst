Service agent help documentation
================================

This is documentation for service agents using the Provider Screening
Module.

Who is allowed to be a service agent?
-------------------------------------

The state/territory Medicaid office decides on criteria for service agents.

Is it acceptable for me to fill out and sign the Provider Statement on the provider's behalf?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please confer with the state/territory Medicaid office.

When the state/territory accepts or rejects an application I've submitted, how do I find out? Is it my responsibility to notify the provider?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right now, this site does not notify you via email or paper mail when
the state/territory accepts or rejects an application you have submitted.
`This will change in a future version of the Provider Screening
Module. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/341>`__

When you log into the PSM, you'll see any applications you've submitted
or started drafting via your PSM user account. You'll be able to see the
status of each application.

Can I submit a batch submission to renew several providers' enrollments?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Currently the PSM does not support this.

How do I change a provider's name in this system? Can I update it in one place for all their applications?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an application is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft application and edit the provider's name. If
you have already submitted the application, then it is not possible to
edit the provider's name. `A future version of the PSM will allow you to
change a provider's name in the
system. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/408>`__

Currently you cannot update multiple draft applications at once.

How do I update the contact information for an approved application? Can I update it in one place for all their applications?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an application is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft application and edit the provider's contact
information. If you have already submitted the application, then it is
not possible to edit the provider's contact information. However, `a
future version of the PSM will let you do
this. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/416>`__

Currently you cannot update multiple draft applications at once.

How do I update the license/certification information for an approved application (e.g., if the provider has renewed their license)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the PSM does not allow you to update information for an
approved application. You'll need to contact the state/territory Medicaid
office directly. `A future version of the PSM will let you do
this. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/416>`__

How do I terminate an application (e.g., if a provider retires or dies)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the PSM does not give you a way to terminate an approved
application, but `a future version of the PSM
will <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/407>`__. Please contact
the state/territory Medicaid office directly to terminate an application.
