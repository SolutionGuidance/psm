<h2>What information do I need to apply to enroll?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-information-do-i-need-to-apply-to-enroll" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

for an account on this
site?”</a>).
Then you’ll need to click the button to create a new enrollment.</p>
<p>An application includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provider/organization information, such as provider type, name, NPI,
and contact information</li>
<li>license and certification information, including a scan of the
license or certification itself</li>
<li>contact and billing/reimbursement addresses for the practice</li>
<li>answers to questions about the provider’s past exclusions, penalties,
terminations, and convictions, if any</li>
<li>information about ownership and potential conflicts (e.g. ownership
over other entities billing Medicaid)</li>
<li>an electronic signature and date attesting to the accuracy of the
enrollment information</li>

<h2>What are the steps in the enrollment process?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-steps-in-the-enrollment-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A provider, a service agent, or a state Medicaid agency staffer
creates and submits a new enrollment application for a particular
provider. (A user can save a draft application and come back later to
finish and submit it.)</li>
<li>A state Medicaid agency staffer reviews the enrollment, using links
provided by the PSM to verify enrollment details, and decides whether
to approve or reject the submission.</li>
<li>After an enrollment has been approved, a state Medicaid agency
staffer can select and renew it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-can-view-enrollments">
<h2>Who can view enrollments?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-can-view-enrollments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A provider can view their own enrollments (including draft, rejected,
approved, and pending enrollments).</p>
<p>A service agent or state Medicaid agency staffer can view all
enrollments (including draft, rejected, approved, and pending
enrollments). (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/10">The PSM may limit this ability in a future
version.</a>)</p>
<p>A system admin should not be able to view any enrollments. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/10">The PSM
currently allows a system admin to view enrollments, but will remove
that capability in a future
version.</a></p>

<p>A provider can modify a draft enrollment, but can’t delete it. A
provider also cannot delete or modify an enrollment after submitting it
(once it is “pending”, “approved”, or “denied”).</p>
<p>A service agent or state Medicaid agency staffer can modify a draft or
pending enrollment, but cannot delete any enrollments.</p>

<h2>How will a provider learn when their enrollment changes status?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-a-provider-learn-when-their-enrollment-changes-status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you log into the PSM, you’ll see any enrollments you’ve submitted
or started drafting via your PSM user account. You’ll be able to see the
status of each enrollment.</p>
<p>Right now, a provider does not receive any email notifications about
their enrollment. (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/341">A future version of the PSM will send email
notifications to providers when the status of your enrollment
changes.</a>)</p>

<h2>Can I create an enrollment for someone else?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-create-an-enrollment-for-someone-else" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>This site lets you save a “draft” at any point while you are creating a
new enrollment. Click the “Save as draft” button. Even if you log out
and then log back in, that draft enrollment will still be available for
you to work on – you will see it in your Dashboard and in the Draft tab
under Enrollments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-start-a-draft-enrollment-and-then-have-someone-else-finish-it-for-me">

<p>Service agents and state Medicaid agency staffers can finish draft
enrollments started by other people. A provider can save a draft
enrollment and then phone or otherwise contact a service agent or the
state Medicaid agency to ask them to help finish it for you. One
provider cannot access, and therefore cannot finish and submit, a draft
enrollment started by another provider.</p>
